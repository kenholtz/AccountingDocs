#The Accounting Team
Responsible for:

###Accounting and Performance Microservice (APMS)
The Accounting and Performance Microservice (APMS) is responsible for ingesting 
an Account's raw Custodial data (Transactions, Positions, etc.) 
and using that to calculate and generate both necessary 
and interesting data and datapoints. The output of APMS helps enable agents to 
understand their accounts' history, current status, and overall performance.

The Accounting team works to support daily data loads, enhance existing functionality, 
and build out new features.

###IO-Sync Microservice
The io-sync service is responsible for synchronizing the bulk of custodial data
from the Legacy (PortfolioPathway) solution to the Intelligent Office system 
in a timely and accurate manner
